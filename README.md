#Beaker - the data scientist's laboratory

Beaker is a code notebook that allows you to analyze, visualize, and document data using multiple programming languages. Beaker's plugin-based polyglot architecture enables you to seamlessly switch between languages in your documents and add support for your favorite languages that we've missed.

Beaker is both a server that you can run in the cloud, an application that you can download and run, and
a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/beakernotebook/beaker/) that you can run anywhere.

This page is for developers.  If you want to use or learn more about Beaker, see the [home page](http://beakernotebook.com).

#Build, test, and run instructions

See the page for your platform for how to build from source:
[Ubuntu](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Ubuntu-build-and-run),
[Mac](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Mac-build-and-run),
[Windows](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Windows-build-and-run), and
[Docker](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/blob/master/Dockerfile).  We use gradle to compile the project.

Say `cd test; ./runner` to run the end-to-end tests with Protractor.

Say `cd test; ./perftest` to run performance tests with Protractor. Performance tests are pretty demanding and will lock up the browser performing the tests. Any interaction with the browser while the tests are running will affect the tests and skew the results.

[![Build Status](http://ec2-54-175-192-115.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=Beaker master)](http://ec2-54-175-192-115.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/job/Beaker master)

To enable the debug menu, add the following to your `beaker.pref.json` file:

    "notebook-app-menu-plugins": ["./plugin/menu/debug.js"]

##Language support

We currently provide support for Python, R, Julia, Groovy, Ruby, Java, Scala, Kdb, Clojure, JavaScript, HTML, Markdown, and LaTeX.

Beaker supports *autotranslation* of variables between languages.  For
example, you can read and process some data in Python, model it with
R, and then turn that into an interactive visualization with
Javascript.

##Architecture

Beaker is primarily composed of a Java server and a Javascript client.
There are plugins for each language, and interaction plugins as well.
The architecture and the organization of the source is code is covered
in the [Architecture
wiki](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Architecture).

Plugin specifications: [Evaluator
plugins](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Eval-plugin-spec),
[Menu
plugins](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Menu-plugin-spec),
[Output display
plugins](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/OutputDisplay-spec)

##Open source
Beaker's full source code and documentation is available under the
Apache 2.0 license.  Beaker's sharing feature uses a server with its
own [repository](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-sharing-server).

##Contributing

We welcome developers to extend and improve Beaker in ways that can
benefit everyone. In order for us to accept your code or pull request,
we need for you to fill out and email back to us a scan of a signed copy of the
[Contributor License Agreement](http://beakernotebook.com/cla.zip).

We're also looking to expand our full-time, NYC-based engineering team
with a [full-stack web developer](http://www.twosigma.com/careers/position/936.html).
