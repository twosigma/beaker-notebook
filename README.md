BeakerX is a collection of JVM kernels and interactive widgets for
plotting, tables, autotranslation, and other extensions to Jupyter
Notebook.  BeakerX is in beta and under active development.

The [documentation](https://github.com/twosigma/beakerx/blob/master/StartHere.ipynb) consists of tutorial notebooks on GitHub.
You can try it in the cloud for free with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/twosigma/beakerx/0.13.0?filepath=StartHere.ipynb).

BeakerX is the successor to the [Beaker Notebook (source code
archive)](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook-archive).  It
comes from [Two Sigma Open
Source](http://opensource.twosigma.com/). Yes we are
[hiring](https://www.twosigma.com/careers).

This README is for developers.  Users should see the
[documentation](http://beakerx.com/documentation) on the homepage for
how to install and run BeakerX.



### Dependencies:

* [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Build and Install

```
conda create -y -n beakerx 'python>=3' nodejs pandas openjdk maven
source activate beakerx
conda install -y -c conda-forge ipywidgets
(cd beakerx; pip install -e . --verbose)
beakerx install
```

### Build and Install for Lab

```
conda create -y -n labx 'python>=3' nodejs pandas openjdk maven
source activate labx
conda install -y -c conda-forge jupyterlab
(cd beakerx; pip install -e . --verbose)
beakerx install
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
(cd js/lab; jupyter labextension install .)
```

### Update after Java change

The kernels are installed to run out of the repo, so just a local
build should suffice:

```
(cd kernel; ./gradlew build)
```

### Update after JS change

The notebook extensions are installed to run out of the repo, so just
a local build should suffice:

```
(cd js/notebook; yarn install)
```

### Run Tests

The Java unit tests are run with every build. See [test/README.md] for how to run the e2e tests.

## Running with Docker

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 beakerx/beakerx
```

## Architecture and Code Overview

BeakerX is a collection of kernels and extensions for Jupyter.
The code is organized into subdirectories as follows:

* [beakerx](beakerx) The Python packages.  The main beakerx package has:

  * a customized KernelSpec to allow BeakerX to configure the JVMs
    started to run the kernels,
  
  * the beakerx command line program, which has the bkr2ipynb
    converter as well as install and uninstall functions,
  
  * the Python API for the runtime (tables, plots, easyform),
    including automatically installing a displayer for pandas tables,
    and autotranslation;
  
  * the webpack (compiled JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, fonts, images);
    and

  * the compiled Java JARs.

  There is a seperate python package (beakerx_magics) for the
  `%%groovy` magic so it can always be loaded *without* loading the
  regular beakerx package (which would turn on display of pandas
  tables with our table widget).

* [doc](doc) Documentation consisting of executable tutorial
  notebooks.  [StartHere.ipynb](StartHere.ipynb) at the top level
  links to these and is the intended way to navigate them.  There is a
  subdirectory for each language.

* [docker](docker) configuration files for creating the Docker image.
  There is a subdirectory [doc/base](doc/base) for an image with
  BeakerX's dependencies (the Ubuntu and conda packages).  The main
  image is built by compiling BeakerX and installing BeakerX in the
  base image.

* [js](js) There are two subdirectories of JavaScript and TypeScript,
  [js/lab](js/lab) and [js/notebook](js/notebook).  New code is being
  written in TypeScript.

  The lab subdirectory has the extension for Jupyter Lab (distributed
  by npm).  Notebook has two extensions, one for the widgets (which
  are included in Lab as well, and are also seperately distributed
  with npm for embedded applications such as nbviewer), and one for
  the notebook application.  This adds a tab to the tree view with our
  options panel.  And for regular notebook pages the extension
  handles:

  * running initialization cells,
  
  * publication,
  
  * autotranslation,
  
  * the getCodeCells and runByTag APIs,
  
  * callbacks for table and plot actions,
  
  * UI customizations such as changing the fonts, allowing wide code
    cells, and disabling autosave.

* [kernel](kernel) The Java implementation of the kernels is here.
  The main directory is [kernel/base](kernel/base) which has generic
  code for all the languages.  The base kernel has classes for
  Jupyter's Comm protocol (a layer over ZMQ), magics, the classpath
  (including loading from maven), and the kernl parts of the widget
  APIs.

  There is also a subdirectory for each language which has the
  evaluator for that language, plus scala has wrappers for the widgets
  so they have native types.

* [test](test) The e2e tests, which are made with wdio (selenium,
  chromedriver, jasmine).

## Attribution

Beaker contains and depends on many projects including:

The kernel is originally derived from
[lappsgrid](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-groovy-kernel),
but has been rewritten in Java and refactored and expanded.

The Java support uses Adrian Witas' org.abstractmeta.toolbox.
