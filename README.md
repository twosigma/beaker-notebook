# BeakerX: Beaker extensions for Jupyter

[![Build Status](http://ec2-54-175-192-115.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=BeakerX%20master)](http://ec2-54-175-192-115.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/job/BeakerX%20master)
[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/twosigma/beakerx.png)](https://gitter.im/twosigma/beakerx)

BeakerX is a collection of JVM kernels with widgets, plotting, tables,
autotranslation, and other extensions to the Jupyter Notebook and
Jupyter Lab.  BeakerX is in alpha, with major features still under
development and refactorings and incompatible changes.  This is true
despite our previous stable releases up to version 1.7.1 because
BeakerX has a whole new architecture based on Jupyter, whereas the
previous releases were an independent application, Beaker Notebook.
You could think of BeakerX as Beaker Notebook 2.0, and this transition
is not yet complete.  Feedback and advice on how to best complete this
process is very welcome.

## Dependencies

* oracle Java8 JDK
* npm, bower, webpack
* conda

## Build and run


```
conda create -y -n beakerx python=3.5 jupyter pandas
source activate beakerx
./gradlew --no-daemon build
./gradlew --no-daemon kernelInstall
./gradlew --no-daemon :beakerx:install
pip install -e .
python -m beaker.install --enable --prefix="${CONDA_PREFIX}"
jupyter notebook
```

## Update after Java change
Ther kernels are installed to run out of the repo, so just a build should update the java code.
* `./gradlew build`

## Update after JS change

* `cd beakerx/js; webpack`

## Beaker Notebooks Converter
```
python -m bkr2ipynb *.bkr
```

## Attribution

The kernel is originally derived from https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-groovy-kernel, but has been rewritten in Java and refactored and expanded.
The Java support uses Adrian Witas' org.abstractmeta.toolbox.
