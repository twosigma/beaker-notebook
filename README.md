BeakerX is a collection of JVM kernels and interactive widgets for
plotting, tables, autotranslation, and other extensions to Jupyter
Notebook.  BeakerX is in beta and under active development.

The [documentation](https://github.com/twosigma/beakerx/blob/master/StartHere.ipynb) consists of tutorial notebooks on GitHub.
You can try it in the cloud for free with [Binder](http://mybinder.org/repo/twosigma/beakerx).

BeakerX is the successor to the [Beaker Notebook (source code
archive)](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook-archive).  It
comes from [Two Sigma Open
Source](http://opensource.twosigma.com/). Yes we are
[hiring](https://www.twosigma.com/careers).

This README is for developers.  Users should see the
[documentation](http://beakerx.com/documentation) on the homepage for
how to install and run BeakerX.



### Dependencies:

* [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Build and Install
#### Installation with Conda
We recommend [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to install Jupyter and BeakerX, and to manage your Python environments. BeakerX works with Python 3.5 and above. Conda forge hosts the [lastest version](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/beakerx).
```%bash
conda create -y -n beakerx 'python>=3'
source activate beakerx
conda install -y -c conda-forge ipywidgets
conda install -y -c conda-forge beakerx
```
#### Running BeakerX with Conda
Start Jupyter with
```%bash
jupyter notebook
```
and then use the “New” menu to create a notebook in the language of your choice.

Note: Make sure that you switch to `source activate beakerx` before running `jupyter notebook` command each time.
##### Upgrading
If you have an environment with a previous version of BeakerX, to upgrade to the latest version use:
```%bash
conda update -c conda-forge beakerx
```
#### Installation with Pip
You can also install BeakerX with [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).
```%bash
pip install beakerx
beakerx-install
```
#### Running BeakerX
Start Jupyter with
```%bash
jupyter notebook
```
and then use the “New” menu to create a notebook in the language of your choice.

### Update after Java change

The kernels are installed to run out of the repo, so just a local
build should suffice:

```
(cd kernel; ./gradlew build)
```

### Update after JS change

The notebook extensions are installed to run out of the repo, so just
a local build should suffice:

```
(cd beakerx/js; yarn install)
```

### Autotranslation from Python to JavaScript

## Running with Docker

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 beakerx/beakerx
```

## Contributing

We welcome developers to extend and improve BeakerX in ways that can
benefit everyone. In order for us to accept your code or pull request,
we need for you to fill out and email back to us a scan of a signed copy of the
[Contributor License Agreement](http://beakernotebook.com/cla.zip).

BeakerX uses [Google Java
style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), and all
Java code needs unit tests.  For JavaScript we use [Google JS
style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) with
[require](http://requirejs.org/) instead of goog.  All files should
end with newline and have a copyright and license banner.


## Attribution

Beaker contains and depends on many projects including:

The kernel is originally derived from
[lappsgrid](https://github.com/lappsgrid-incubator/jupyter-groovy-kernel),
but has been rewritten in Java and refactored and expanded.

The Java support uses Adrian Witas' org.abstractmeta.toolbox.
