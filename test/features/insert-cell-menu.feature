Feature: CodeCell insert menu use
As a researcher I should be able to add new cells inside of
a notebook via a menu located by each codecell.

Background:
  Given I am viewing beaker
  Then I see the the user dashboard
  And I create a notebook
  Then I should see a new notebook
  Then I should see notebook cells
  Then I should hide the outputlogger

Scenario: Toggling a insert cell menu
  When I click the '1' insert cell menu toggle
  Then I should see a open insert cell menu on cell '1'
